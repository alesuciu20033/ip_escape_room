# Enversed Studios Industry Project

## Introduction to the project

To create a minigame concept for Enversed Studios, based on the murder and mystery theme, while including some detective scenes.

## Our approach

Initially, we created our individual concepts. Based on the feedback from teachers and clients, we decided to choose one of the concepts and develop it further. Our final concept is a combination of steps that the player has to follow in order to resolve the mystery. The players need to read clues, resolve a word puzzle, find passwords, and gather all the information to win the game.

## Features

## Branches by team members
Every single person in our team worked in a separate branch, developing a specific part of the mini-game, based on a previous group task division.
